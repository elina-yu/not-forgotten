## What is Project NotForgotten?
There have already been 12 incidents of school shootings in the US since 2018 began but how many people even know about this? Do people even know which schools these incidents occurred in?
Project NotForgotten is project devoted to spreading awareness to the growing number of incidents and also helping people to **not forget**.
We made a Twitter Bot that replies when prompted with key words "since", "last", a date or a given time span. The bot replies with the number of incidents, casualties and injuries within the time span prompted.
